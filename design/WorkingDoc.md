### Current TODO list
* Figure out which GUI framework to use


##### Problem specification

The program is the prototype of a traffic simulator which aims to demonstrate traffic flow. The program consist of one 
car, two roads, and a traffic light placed in between. Once the program starts the car will move from the beginning 
of the first road towards the end, where the traffic light is placed. When the traffic light is green, the car will
cross over to road 2, drive down to the end of the road, before being placed back at starting position on road 1. 

This will act as a simulation which can highlight shortcomings in road design, visualizing points of congestion.
