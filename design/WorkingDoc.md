##### Problem specification

The program is a prototype of a traffic simulator which aims to demonstrate traffic flow. The program consist of a 
set of roads, traffic lights and cars.  
The cars will drive according to traffic lights and respawn at road 0 when the end of the map is reached. 
There are collision handling for vehicles. 


Per this release the traffic is one way, and changes to the map has to be manually done by adding lines of code.
The current version is only good for simulating traffic flow in one direction.
