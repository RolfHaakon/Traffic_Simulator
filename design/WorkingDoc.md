### Current TODO list
* Fill out classes according to UML
* Build tests for methods
* Figure out which GUI framework to use


#### Task Description
1. Document the Software development process
2. Present the code design in the form of UML class diagrams
3. Establish a GitHub repository and start implementing the code using the UML class diagrams

- Design will be in the form of a UML diagram

#### Working document will describe:

##### Problem specification

The program is the prototype of a traffic simulator which aims to demonstrate traffic flow. The program consist of one 
car, two roads, and a traffic light placed in between. Once the program starts the car will move from the beginning 
of the first road towards the end, where the traffic light is placed. When the traffic light is green, the car will
cross over to road 2, drive down to the end of the road, before being placed back at starting position on road 1. 

This will act as a simulation which can highlight shortcomings in road design, visualizing points of congestion.

 
    
### For first part of project
1. Produce a working document that illustrates your designs for approximately 4-6 classes – one of which will be the Main class that contains the main() method.
2. The classes should be drawn in a UML class diagram – the diagram should include information about class names,
 member field access control, method access control and class relationships (you get marks for using the correct UML notation for these things)
3. Pick at least 3 classes and start implementing them – include appropriate test classes that check and verify that these 3 production classes
 are working as expected - there is no need to create a test class for the Main class!
