# TrafficSimulator
A traffic simulator in Java for the programming 3 course

#### Task Description
1. Document the Software development process
2. Present the code design in the form of UML class diagrams
3. Establish a GitHub repository and start implementing the code using the UML class diagrams

- Design will be in the form of a UML diagram

#### Working document will describe:

##### Problem specification
* What is the problem? 
* How will the program be used? 
* How will the program behave?

##### Problem decomposition 
(Using UML class diagrams)
* What objects will be used and how will they interact?
* Divide the problem into objects
* The UML class diagram should answer the following design questions:

1.Class design
* What role do objects of the class perform?
* What member fields do objects of this class need? public or private?
* What methods do objects of this class need? public or private?
2. Method design:
* What should its method signature be?
* What task will it perform? What algorithm will it use?
 
    
### For first part of project
1. Produce a working document that illustrates your designs for approximately 4-6 classes – one of which will be the Main class that contains the main() method.
2. The classes should be drawn in a UML class diagram – the diagram should include information about class names, member field access control, method access control and class relationships (you get marks for using the correct UML notation for these things)
3. Pick at least 3 classes and start implementing them – include appropriate test classes that check and verify that these 3 production classes are working as expected - there is no need to create a test class for the Main class!
4. You get marks for ensuring that your class code matches your UML class diagrams – there is no need to include the test classes in your UML class diagrams!
